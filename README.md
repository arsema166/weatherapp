# Weather App

This is a simple weather application built using HTML, Bootstrap, and Axios. The app allows users to search for weather data by entering a city name.

### Technologies Used
- HTML5
- Bootstrap (for responsive design)
- Axios (for API calls)
- OpenWeatherMap API (for weather data)

### How to Use
1. Enter a city name in the input box.
2. Click the "Search" button.
3. The weather information for that city will be displayed, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

### Axios Implementation
Axios is used to send a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API. Upon success, weather data is displayed in the DOM. Error handling is included in case the city is not found or if there's an issue with the API request.
